# KOSMA AI Aggregator

> **Multi-Model AI Response Synthesis Platform**  
> *Powered by Mercury Intelligence*

## 📋 Project Purpose

The KOSMA AI Aggregator is an intelligent synthesis platform that consults multiple leading AI models simultaneously and provides users with unified, confidence-scored responses. Rather than forcing users to query different AI services individually, our platform aggregates insights from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI to deliver superior answers through advanced synthesis algorithms.

### Vision Statement
To democratize access to the collective intelligence of multiple AI systems, providing users with more reliable, comprehensive, and trustworthy AI-generated insights than any single model could provide alone.

### Problem Statement
- **Fragmented AI Landscape**: Users must switch between ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other AI services
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Different models excel in different domains, leading to suboptimal responses
- **Time Inefficiency**: Consulting multiple AIs manually is time-consuming and tedious
- **Decision Paralysis**: When AI models disagree, users struggle to determine which response to trust

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1. **Multi-Model Aggregation**
- **Simultaneous Queries**: Sends user prompts to OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini in parallel
- **Real-time Processing**: Leverages async API calls with intelligent timeout handling
- **Fallback Systems**: Graceful degradation when individual AI services are unavailable

### 2. **Advanced Response Synthesis**
- **Similarity Analysis**: Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to measure agreement between AI responses
- **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates confidence levels (High 70%+, Medium 30-70%, Low <30%) based on model consensus
- **Intelligent Combination**: Three synthesis approaches based on response similarity:
  - **High Confidence**: Combines similar responses with additional unique insights
  - **Multiple Perspectives**: Highlights common themes while noting disagreements
  - **Diverse Approaches**: Presents different AI strategies side-by-side

### 3. **Professional User Interface**
- **Chat-Style Interface**: Modern conversational UI inspired by ChatGPT and Claude
- **Mercury Bank Design Language**: Professional fintech-grade visual design
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Real-time Feedback**: Loading states, confidence indicators, and source attribution

### 4. **Transparency & Trust**
- **Individual Response Access**: Users can expand to view each AI's original response
- **Source Attribution**: Clear indication of which models contributed to the synthesis
- **Processing Metrics**: Shows response times and synthesis reasoning
- **Error Handling**: Transparent communication when AI services fail

### 5. **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**
- **Robust Error Handling**: Continues functioning even when individual APIs fail
- **Enhanced Mock Responses**: Provides meaningful fallback content during API outages
- **Rate Limiting Protection**: Intelligent queuing to respect API limitations
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time backend connectivity status

## 🔧 Core Responsibilities

### Frontend Application (`frontend/`)
- **User Interface**: React-based chat interface with Mercury Bank styling
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts optimized for all devices
- **State Management**: Conversation history, loading states, and error handling
- **API Communication**: Axios-based HTTP client for backend integration
- **User Experience**: Auto-scrolling, message animations, and accessibility features

### Backend Services (`backend/`)

#### **Primary Server** (`server.js`)
- **API Gateway**: Express.js server handling client requests
- **Request Orchestration**: Manages parallel calls to multiple AI services
- **Response Aggregation**: Collects and processes AI responses
- **Error Management**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Health Monitoring**: Service status endpoints and logging

#### **AI Service Integrations** (`services/`)
- **OpenAI Service** (`openAIService.js`): GPT-3.5-turbo integration with fallback handling
- **Anthropic Service** (`anthropicService.js`): Claude Haiku integration with credit monitoring
- **Google AI Service** (`googleAIService.js`): Gemini Pro integration with model fallbacks
- **Synthesis Engine** (`synthesisService.js`): Core algorithm for response analysis and combination

#### **Synthesis Algorithm** (`synthesisService.js`)
- **Text Similarity Calculation**: Jaccard similarity for response comparison
- **Content Analysis**: Sentence splitting, key point extraction, and theme identification
- **Consensus Detection**: Identifies agreement and disagreement patterns
- **Response Generation**: Creates unified responses based on synthesis approach

### Configuration & Environment
- **Environment Variables**: Secure API key management
- **CORS Configuration**: Cross-origin request handling
- **Rate Limiting**: API usage monitoring and throttling
- **Deployment Ready**: Production-optimized build processes

## 🎯 Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.0, Axios, Modern CSS (Grid/Flexbox)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express 5.1.0, Axios
- **AI APIs**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo, Anthropic Claude Haiku, Google Gemini Pro
- **Development**: Vite, Nodemon, Environment-based configuration

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Frontend → Backend API → AI Services (Parallel) → Synthesis Engine → Unified Response → Frontend Display
```

### Quality Assurance
- **Graceful Degradation**: Functions with partial AI service availability
- **Cost Optimization**: Uses efficient AI models (GPT-3.5, Claude Haiku, Gemini Pro)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Request timing and success rate tracking
- **User Feedback**: Confidence scores and reasoning transparency
